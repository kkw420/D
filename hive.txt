1) Create, Insert & Select: 
CREATE TABLE flights (flight_id INT, flight_date STRING,carrier STRING,origin 
> STRING,destination STRING,dep_delay INT,arr_delay INT) row format delimited fields 
> terminated by ',' stored as textfile; 
INSERT INTO TABLE flights VALUES (1001, '2008-01-01', 'AA', 'JFK', 'LAX', 10, 5); 
select * from flights; 
2) Alter table: 
hive> ALTER TABLE flights ADD COLUMNS (flight_duration INT); 
3) External Table: 
CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE IF NOT EXISTS external_airports (airport_code 
STRING,airport_name STRING, city STRING, state string) row format delimited fields terminated 
by ',' stored as textfile; 
insert into table external_airports values("CSTM","shivaji maharaj","mumbai", "MH"); 
select * from external_airports; 
LOAD DATA LOCAL INPATH '/home/pl/Desktop/external_airport.txt' INTO TABLE 
external_airports; 
select * from external_airports; 
3) Join: 
SELECT f.flight_id, a.airport_name 
FROM flights f 
JOIN external_airports a 
ON f.origin = a.airport_code; 
4) Average operation: 
SELECT AVG(dep_delay) AS avg_departure_delay 
FROM flight; 
5) Indexing: 
CREATE INDEX idx_airport_code 
ON TABLE external_airports (airport_code) 
AS 'COMPACT' 
WITH DEFERRED REBUILD; 
ALTER INDEX idx_airport_code ON external_airports REBUILD;
